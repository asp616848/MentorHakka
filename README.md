### How it Works

1. **Home Screen**: Upon opening the app, users are presented with the home screen where they can input their journal entry and aim.
   - Users can navigate to the history screen to view past entries and responses.
   - Once the user provides a journal entry and aim, they can request guidance.

2. **Generating Guidance**: When the user requests guidance, the application sends the journal entry and aim to the Generative Model API.
   - The model processes the input, considering factors such as the user's aim and the content of their journal entry.
   - It generates a personalized response tailored to the user's needs and goals.

3. **Displaying Response**: The generated response is displayed on the home screen, providing the user with guidance, advice, and suggestions for improvement.
   - The response is based on the analysis of the user's input and aims to assist them in their personal growth journey.

4. **History Screen**: Users can access the history screen to review past journal entries and the corresponding responses provided by the application.
   - This feature allows users to reflect on their progress over time and revisit previous guidance as needed.
